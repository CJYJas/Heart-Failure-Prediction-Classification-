  description: >
    A beginner machine learning project using logistic regression, decision trees,
    KNN, and random forest to predict heart failure events based on clinical data.
    This project was completed as part of my pre-university AI studies.

  project_structure:
    - Heart_Failure_Prediction.ipynb
    - README.yaml

  methods_used:
    - Data Cleaning
    - Feature Engineering
    - Data Visualization
    - Model Training
    - Model Evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)

  models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Random Forest

  tools:
    - Python
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn

  results:
    summary: >
      The best performing model was Random Forest, achieving a F1_score of 0.91 and
      on the test data. Feature scaling was used to improve model performance.

  future_work:
    - Explore advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM
    - Perform feature selection and PCA
    - Try deep learning models
    - Participate in Kaggle competitions for further practice

  acknowledgements:
    - This project was inspired by online ML tutorials and my preparation for university AI courses.
    - Thanks to the Kaggle community for providing the dataset.
